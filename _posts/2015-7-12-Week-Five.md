Allow me to describe the saga of Project 3. Our task was to implement an Integer class similar to Java's BigInteger and use our implementation to calculate the 20th Mersenne prime. Calculating the 30th Mersenne prime gave you a bonus. When Professor Downing went over the project in class, I was pretty confident I knew what I was doing. I coded the constructor and shift_digits methods and actually felt like I was getting somewhere. Then, I moved onto the math portions of the project, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. At this point, I realized this wasn't going to be as easy as I previously thought because I couldn't remember how to perform basic math operations. It was very humbling to type "how to divide" into Google. However, once I brushed up on elementary math, I developed a plan. Still relatively confident I knew how to execute the solution, I figured I had more than enough time to finish the project since I had the whole day before it was due to code my approach. 

This is when it went downhill. It was about 2pm and I had 8 hours until the project was due and after attempting to add simple +=, -= and *= operators, my whole program was failing in new and exciting ways! So I headed to the lab and spent far too long figuring out how to fix my mistakes. I had attempted to run some of my classmates tests from the public repo, but oddly, a few hours before the deadline, there weren't very many tests up, which is atypical. I headed home after the study session and continued to work, but was unable to finish in time. Luckily for me, we got a 24 hour extension.

The next day, I was still having memory problems, but decided to move on and come back to that later. I got the rest of the program working and all I had left to fix was the multiplication operator. Unfortunately, this was a pretty big part of the project. Without multiplication working, power wouldn't work either which killed my Mersenne output. I worked on this issue all day. Seven hours later, one line of code was the culprit.

Tip of the Week: Start the projects early. Had I started earlier, I would have had plenty of cushion to get stuck on a bug for a whole day and still turn the project in on time.
