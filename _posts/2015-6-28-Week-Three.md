title: Week Three
---

This week we had our second programming assignment due. It was another Sphere Online Judge problem and this time focused on Project File Dependencies. Given an input file that gave the dependencies of certain tasks, output the ordering. Last assignment we were given skeleton files to populate with our Collatz_eval method, but this time we were on our own to  create the main file, the run harness, and the test harness. I got a bit overwhelmed at the beginning of the project. I was trying to model the new project on Collatz, but instead of following the recommended ordering, I got stuck on how I wanted to write the code, so I just started coding parts of the solution before adding test cases and thought I'd figure it out as I went. Bad idea. I started writing the project code before the test code and was getting stuck working on incorrect output because I had no explicit gtest output telling me exactly what went wrong. This was an incredibly difficult model to work with. After spending a few hours not knowing what the hell I was doing, I stopped, and went back to plan out what I would need before writing any code. Unsurprisingly, things went much more smoothly from that point forward.

We have our first test on Monday. I'm pretty nervous about what to expect. Downing said the whole test is in C++ code, which I have not done before ever. Most exams generally have some multiple choice or maybe a small coding section, but the whole test? No way. We'll see how that goes. We were given a topics list, and after defining all the topics, my plan is to begin writing easy code snippets on paper to get used to the format. I'd hate to get to the test and forget something simple just because I've never written it down before.

Tip of the Week: Find a study group or partner and study together. They can help you fill in the gaps, and vice versa.
