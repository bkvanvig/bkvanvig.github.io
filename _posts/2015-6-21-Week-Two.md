title: Week Two
---

This week our first project was due. Because of the recent excessive rain, both our study session and first project were delayed a day. I have been getting in the habit of spending a few hours in the lab after our class to work on the project which has been really helpful. I was nearly done with Project 1 a week before it was due. So, naturally, I didn't touch it until the following week. I had forgotten about the delayed study session, so I was fortuitously in the lab when the study session began and got some vital help on the project right before it was due. I will definitely be utilizing those study sessions in the future. 

I'm getting much more comfortable with the layout of the class. I'm getting more comfortable answering questions in front of my classmates and I think others are feeling the same. More people are asking questions which really helps clarify the material. I like that each class starts with a quiz so we can monitor our progress. It definitely has helped illuminate any sections of the class I'm not fully understanding. 

The one part of the class I haven't quite adjusted used to is the timing of the reading. There are articles required which are easily able to be read the day before, but I need to remember the textbook reading needs a few days to comfortably get through.

Tip of the Week: Pair programming begins this week. Find a partner for bonus points!
