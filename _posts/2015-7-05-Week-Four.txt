This week we had our first test. I was very unsure what to expect since this was my first test with Professor Downing. We were told all questions are code snippets and that was new to me. I'm used to giving the output of a given code snippet, and maybe writing a few lines of code, but it definitely wasn't the whole test. I prepared pretty well for it. Taking the test was definitely doable, but there were parts that tripped me up. For one, I wasn't 100% clear on how to return certain class functions, and that turned out to be the only thing that I looked up later and realized I had messed up. The rest of the test I did very well. 

Last week I suggested joining a study group to prepare for the exam. Additionally, I would absolutely advise finding simple practice problems and physically writing them out on paper. Something about changing mediums really threw me off in the beginning and I was glad I got that initial adjustment out while practicing problems rather than during the test. 

The only frustration I have is not being thorough enough when double checking. One mistake I know I made as soon as I walked out was trying to return a reference to an object instead of a bool. Had I stopped for a second and asked myself what this should be returning logically, the answer would have been obvious. But instead I was too busy making sure the format was correct that I didn't have the presence of mind to check my answers. That's a lesson I need to remember for test 2.

Tip of the Week: Learn from my mistakes and double check the logic of your test answers. Maybe it will save you the few points I lost being careless.
