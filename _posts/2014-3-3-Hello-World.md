title: Generic Programming: Week 1
---

I have completed my first week of Glenn Downing's course entitled CS 378: Generic Programming and the STL. In true first week form, there have been a few adjustments. 

The first adjustment has been to learn C++, which I have never used before. Luckily, the lectures and the assigned book reading did a very good job of introducing us to the syntax. C++ is also syntactically similar to C which helps. I started this week knowing next to nothing about C++ and now I'm pretty comfortable using it. Not bad for only a week.

Instead of talking to a silent classroom for two hours, Downing calls on a few people during class and talks about the material he's presenting. Not going to lie, this is intimidating. I was afraid of messing up and making a fool of yourself. But there's nothing like the fear of public embarrassment to keep you on top of your work. With that fear comes an advantage: I pay closer attention, I take better notes, and I get my work done. 

The next adjustment is to realize I'm going to have to talk to people. Believe it or not, we actually have to *talk* to each other, which is ridiculous, right? This past week we've been prompted to introduce ourselves to the people around us and to discuss a code snippet that was failing some test conditions. That's two times! In a world where generally you sit in silence for a couple hours, this is weird. What's also weird is how it only took two times for the class to feel worlds more comfortable. Probably the most palpable difference between Professor Downing's course and other courses I've taken in the past is the collaborative nature he encourages. It's also probably my favorite thing about this class so far. 



Tip of the Week: Don't be late. Attendance is taken during the first minute of class.
